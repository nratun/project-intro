# Boolean Bananza

## Elevator Pitch

*PITCH GOES HERE*

## Influences (Brief)

- *Yoshi's Cookie*:
  - Medium: *Console Game*
  - Explanation: *Yoshi's Cookie is our inspiration for determining how objects on the board could be moved. Columns/rows can be shifted vertically or horizontally to change the location of a block (i.e, the game is NOT a drag-and-drop).*
- *Candy Crush:*:
  - Medium: *Mobile Game*
  - Explanation: *Candy Crush is our inspiration for implementing a limited number of moves and required matches in order to complete each level (Ex. You need to get 2 expressions evaluated to True to pass), as well as having a score system that rewards players based off how many moves they took to complete a match.*
- *Sudoku*:
  - Medium: *Puzzle Game*
  - Explanation: *Sudoku is our inspiration for the grid-based board layout and how matches can be made (i.e, if the whole row/column is correct, then a match is made).*

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Brief)

*Give a very high-level description of any core gameplay mechanics*

- *Move around the board with WASD keys*
- *Shift the blocks in each row/column using arrow keys*
- *When all the blocks in a row/column evaluate to True or the specified value, a match is made and the row/column disappears*
- *New blocks take the place of any that were disappeared from a previous match (i.e, this is done by shifting blocks down and dropping new ones into the empty space)*
- *Players have limited moves, where each time a player moves off of a block whose position was shifted, their moves decrease by one*
- *A level is completed if players gather the required amount of specified matches*
- *A level is lost if players run out of moves before gathering the required amount of specified matches*
- *When players make a match with a new expression, they can refer back to it through a list that displays every new match made in that level (i.e, expressions from other/replayed levels are not kept)*
- *Players who have trouble with understanding the logic behind matches can refer to a help section that offers examples and explanations*
- *When a level is completed, the player's score is shown on the screen and they are given the options to replay the level, move to the next level, view the new expressions they've created, or return to the title screen*
- *Players who do not successfully complete a level will see their score on the screen and will be given the options to replay the level, view the new expressions they've created, or return to the title screen*

# Learning Aspects

## Learning Domains

*Introductory comptational/programming logic*

## Target Audiences

*Novice programmers with little/no prior programming experience*
*Appropriate for all ages*

## Target Contexts

*This could be offered as additional practice in a course that teaches conditional logic involving expressions that evaluate to True or False*
*The game may also serve as an introduction to conditional logic concepts for unfamiliar players*
*Due to the use of audio, it may not be appropraite for a classroom activity*
*Because the controls rely on WASD and arrow keys, it may not work for devices that do not have a QWERTY keyboard (i.e, unsuitable for mobile gameplay)*


## Learning Objectives

*Remember, Learning Objectives are NOT simply topics. They are statements of observable behavior that a learner can do after the learning experience. You cannot observe someone "understanding" or "knowing" something.*

- *Creating Boolean Expressions*: *By the end of the gameplay, players will be able to construct Boolean expressions by chaining together blocks of True, False, And, Or, Not, and other elements/expressions that can be equated to True or False*
- *Evaluating Truthiness*: *By the end of the lesson, players will be able to evaluate Boolean expressions and determine whether they equate to True or False*

## Prerequisite Knowledge

*What do they need to know prior to trying this game?*

- *Prior to the game, players need to be able to define what Boolean values are*
- *Prior to the game, players must be able to identify the syntax and meaning of logical operators (Ex. NOT, AND, OR)*

## Assessment Measures

*A short pre-test and matching post-test should be designed to assess student learning.*

- *Given a boolean expression, determine whether it will evaluate to True or False*
- *Create a boolean expression given certain criteria (Ex. Use specific logical operators, make the expression evaluate to a given value)*
- *Given a boolean expression, explain why the answer does or does not evaluate to the answer that is provided*
- *Multiple choice questions that test students on how boolean operators work*

# What sets this project apart?

*Give some reasons why this game is not like every other game out there. Whether the learning objective is unique, the gameplay mechanics are new, or what. You should persuade the reader that your game is novel and worthy of development. Consider arguments that would be persuasive to a Venture Capitalist, Teacher, or Researcher. These might be focused on learning needs, too.*

- *Reason #1*
- *Reason #2*
- *Reason #3*
- *Reason #4*
- *etc.*

# Player Interaction Patterns and Modes

## Player Interaction Pattern

*Describe how people play your game, how many players are involved at once, how they interact with the system works, etc.*

## Player Modes

*Your game has one or more player modes. Describe each discrete mode, considering things like menus too. Generally describe the transitions between modes too.*

- *Player mode #1*: *Description*
- *Player mode #2*: *Description*
- *etc.*

# Gameplay Objectives

- *Primary Objective #1*:
    - Description: *Description*
    - Alignment: *Describe how this aligns with one or more learning objectives*
- *Primary Objective #2*:
    - Description: *Description*
    - Alignment: *Describe how this aligns with one or more learning objectives*
- *etc.*

# Procedures/Actions

*Describe the control scheme and what actions a user can take in the game.*

# Rules

*What resources are available to the player that they make use of?  How does this affect gameplay? How are these resources finite?*

# Objects/Entities

*What other things are in the world that you need to design? These may or may not directly translate to actual objects and classes.*

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Detailed)

- *Core Gameplay Mechanic #1*: *Describe in 2 paragraphs or less, along with how it generally works*
- *Core Gameplay Mechanic #2*: *Describe in 2 paragraphs or less, along with how it generally works*
- *Core Gameplay Mechanic #3*: *Describe in 2 paragraphs or less, along with how it generally works*

    
## Feedback

*Explicitly describe what visual/audio/animation indicators there are that give players feedback on their progress towards their gameplay objectives (and ideally the learning objectives).*

*Describe what longer-term feedback you detect and give that guides the player in their learning and lets them know how they are doing in regards to the learning objectives.*

# Story and Gameplay

## Presentation of Rules

*Briefly describe how the player will learn the gameplay mechanics. Avoid using walls of text, since people will not read them. Think instead of natural ways of teaching mechanics iteratively and slowly.*

## Presentation of Content

*Briefly describe how the player will be taught the core material they are meant to learn. Avoid using walls of text, since people will not read them. Think instead of natural ways of teaching material iteratively and slowly.*

## Story (Brief)

*The Summary or TL;DR version of below*

## Storyboarding

*Go into as much detail as needs be to visually convey the Dynamics of your game. Be detailed. Create storyboards and freeze frame images that concisely capture important key elements of your game. You are strongly recommended to sketch pictures on paper and embed them here. Be sure make it clear how previously-described mechanics come through in the dynamics.*

# Assets Needed

## Aethestics

*Give a sense of the aesthetics of your game, the spirit and atmosphere. Use descriptive, evocative words that can help the reader understand the emotional response of your game.*
